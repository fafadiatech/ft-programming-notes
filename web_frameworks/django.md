## [Qualities of great reusable Django apps by Fl√°vio Juvenal da Silva Junior]

1. Concept {For re-usable apps}:
    - Do one thing and one thing well
    - Easy to check: if you can describe what your app does in few words
1. What maps a django app great?
    - Easy to install
        - Make it available on PyPi `pip install django-something`
        - Use wheels for distribution
        - Add LINCENSE
        - Add it to `Django Packages`
        - Check if its Django vs Python Packages
            - Djang App: If it needs to be added to `INSTALLED_APPS`
            - Python: Otherwise
        - Have good defaults
        - Make sure you have right prefixed settings "DJANGO_SOMETHING_SOMETHING"
        - Friendly upgrade policy
            - Use deprecation warnings before removing
            - Use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
    - Easy to use
        - Provide Documentation
            - Write docs **first** 
            - Think about problem first and comeup with simple solution
            - Provide a **quick-start** tutorial, this will cover most of the common use-cases
            - Separate high-level docs from low-level docs {Django does this}
            - Use gender neutral pronouns
        - Ship with an example project
        - Fail-fast: Raise errors if developers have forgotten to update default settings
    - Easy to integrate
        - Easy to **adapt** to project needs
