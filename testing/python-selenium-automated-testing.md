# Notes on Automated testing via Selenium {In Python}

[Functional Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) as defined by Wikipedia: 

> Functional testing is a quality assurance (QA) process[1] and a type of black-boxtesting that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered (unlike white-box testing).[2] Functional testing usually describes what the system does.

## Techniques for discovering good usecases for Functional Testing

1. Manual Scripted Testing
    1. Writing re-usable testcases
    1. Design test that are driven by test data and configurations
    1. Priortize high-risk and complex test cases
1. Exploratory Testing
    1. > Exploratory testing is a time-boxed approach in which testers set out a certain amount of time to “explore” the software. Although this is also a form of manual testing, exploratory testing deviates from a strict workflow of planning, designing, and executing test case steps. During this session, testers aim to understand how the software works and identify different tests to run based on that understanding. Since exploratory testing is not scripted, it often mirrors how users will interact with software in real life.
    1. Use system with basic functional requirement specification to understand whats going on
1. Risk Based Testing
    1. > Risk-based testing is an organizational approach that prioritizes testing for high-risk areas of software. It contends that high-risk areas need to be tested often and have a high level of test coverage in order to mitigate the risk.
    1. Assert risk at project level
    1. Develop a contingency plan
    1. Use static analysis tools

## Key Concepts

1. TestCase:
1. setUp and tearDown
1. BaseTestCase:
1. Role:
1. Fixture: 
1. Migrations:
