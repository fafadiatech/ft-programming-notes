# Notes on Automated testing via Selenium {In Python}

[Functional Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) as defined by Wikipedia:	

> Functional testing is a quality assurance (QA) process[1] and a type of black-boxtesting that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered (unlike white-box testing).[2] Functional testing usually describes what the system does.
